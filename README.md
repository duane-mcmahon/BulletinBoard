Web Database Applications: Assignment 2
CPT375/ISYS3352 SP2, 2015



The outcome of the assignment is a web database application. The assignment is divided into
several parts and the parts are required to be attempted in order. Information on how this
assignment is assessed is provided later in the “Assessment and Gradings” section.
You must develop the system using the MySQL database management system (in a UNIX
environment), PHP as the web scripting language.
Note: A pure shopping cart would receive ZERO marks.
Your team might receive lower marks if your efforts are directed to non-technical requirements
at the expense of this course’s technical requirements. It is better to have a functioning web
application with minimal features than to have a full feature web applications that is nonfunctioning.
Your system should demonstrate the following features:
1. A relational or object-relational third-tier database, with appropriate database security,
integrity and referential constraints, and a correct, at least third-normal form database
2. A medium-scale database, with around five to ten tables, and at least 100 records in at
least one of the tables. These records should be easily testable from your web
applications. You may generate random records to fill up the numbers rather than
manually inserting these rows to your database.
3. Significant join queries that show use of the SQL ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, or
nested queries
4. A medium-size web environment of at least ten separate screens, of which at least three
should permit moderately complex user input that is used for user-driven querying
5. Templates
6. User authentication
7. State maintenance with a session management library or tools
8. Server-side scripts
9. Client-side and server-side user input validation
10. Professional User Interface (UI)
You may choose one of the following topics-
● An auction site
● A bulletin board or chat system
● An event announcement or news site
● A survey system
● Internet banking site

[![CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/img/cake-logo.png)](http://www.cakephp.org)

CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller and MVC.
Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any loss to flexibility.
